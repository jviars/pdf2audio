# pdf2audio
Simple application to convert a PDF to audio. 

## This is the Python version which requires PyPDF2 & pyttsx3 as dependencies. For a fully-packaged Windows version, please see "releases".

### You are welcome to do what you'd like with this code, as it was only created to improve my Python skills.
