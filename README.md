# pdf2audio
Simple application to convert a PDF to audio. 

## This is the Python version which requires PyPDF2 & pyttsx3 as dependencies. For a fully-packaged Windows version, please see "releases".

## Due to limitations with Pyinstaller, the Windows version is flagged as malware. Since this is for leisure, this may or may not be fixed by me in the future. Current workarounds include allowing the application through your antivirus or running the Python directly. 

### You are welcome to do what you'd like with this code, as it was only created to improve my Python skills.
